tutorials / resources for theatre, digital media, and radical action
This is a running source of links to things I'm interested in and tutorials for some different programs. Each tutorial should have an accompanying video with audios or manual.

## resources & example artists

### theatre

- [Nextasy](http://nextasy.com/about) | Creates innovative projects as Cirque du Soleil's in-house innovation student [intern target]

- [Suguru Yamamoto](https://performingarts.jp/E/art_interview/1501/1.html) Created *Girl X* and utilizes interaction of projected text + performer

### digital media

**digital media** or **projection design** encompasses the arts of using technologies to augment, accent, stand in for, replace, fuck with, and embolden live performance. Most of these designers are white men, unfortunately, and in the dark humor spirit of those living under cis oppression, I dub these masses of geeky white guys, my **Digital Deviance Daddies**. Yeah, we've got a fucked relationship, but they're where it all started (or are they?). I've also sought out work from Othered perspectives, and yes, they're **DDDaddies** too.

And some of these are faceless corporate websites you should def weaponize against capitalism.

- [ANTIVJ](https://antivj.com/) is a visual label and design studio specializing in spatially-informed projection design based out of Brussels. The artist *Romain Tardy* is also from this label.

### radical action

## bookz

An elegant weapon, for a more civilized age. The printed word, the focused narrative lines, these bookz are some recent reads of mine that I catalog.

- [Projection Design & Digital Media] by Oliszewski, Fine, and Roth. The definitive guide to digital media design for the stage, encompassing projection scheduling and typical workflows and Content Creation. The DDDaddies came through on this one. √√√√√

- [Devising in Process] by Heddon and Milling. A critical history of devising methodologies in Britain, America, and Australia. While the scope is frustratingly Western-centric, Heddon and Milling's clarity is beyond question. √√√√

- [After Effects for Designers](https://search.lib.umich.edu/articles/record/FETCH-LOGICAL-a22266-be2c195351b7a87e7a1f95d277e205c383a85885f2d263467be537da5aa0b8c73) by Chris Jackson. STILL TO READ.

- [Design for Motion: Motion Design Techniques and Fundamentals] by Austin Shaw. Find it on Libgen.

- [Film Directing Fundamentals] by Nicholas Proferes. A. Dobbins recommendation. STILL TO READ.
