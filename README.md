tutorials / resources for theatre, digital media, and radical action
This is a running source of links to things I'm interested in and tutorials for some different programs. Each tutorial should have an accompanying video with audios or manual.

## resources & example artists

### theatre

- [Nextasy](http://nextasy.com/about) | Creates innovative projects as Cirque du Soleil's in-house innovation student [intern target]

- [Suguru Yamamoto](https://performingarts.jp/E/art_interview/1501/1.html) Created *Girl X* and utilizes interaction of projected text + performer

### digital media

**digital media** or **projection design** encompasses the arts of using technologies to augment, accent, stand in for, replace, fuck with, and embolden live performance. Most of these designers are white men, unfortunately, and in the dark humor spirit of those living under cis oppression, I dub these masses of geeky white guys, my **Digital Deviance Daddies**. Yeah, we've got a fucked relationship, but they're where it all started (or are they?). I've also sought out work from Othered perspectives, and yes, they're **DDDaddies** too.

And some of these are faceless corporate websites you should def weaponize against capitalism.
